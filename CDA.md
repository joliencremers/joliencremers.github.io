## Circular Data in the Social Sciences

During my masters and PhD I worked on developing Bayesian methods for the
analysis of circular (longitudinal) data in the social sciences, mostly using
the embedding approach to circular data, specifically on models employing the
projected normal (PN) distribution. A copy of the dissertation can be found [[here]](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/380364).

The embedding approach models the circular location and spread are modeled
simultaneously and is very flexible regarding the type of models that can be
fit. Interpretation of the parameter estimates from these models is however
challenging, so several subprojects focus on the development of interpretation
tools.


#### PN regression models

Investigation of the performance of two MCMC algorithms for estimating PN
regression models. In this project, we have also analysed data from an
interpersonal circumplex using the PN regression model.

Several measures to make the interpretation of regression effects on the circle
easier:

Introduction and comparison of tools that can be used to distinguish between accuracy and location
effects in a PN regression model:

#### PN mixed-effects models

Application of a Bayesian PN mixed-effects model to several repeated measures
datasets from an interpersonal circumplex. The focus lies on how a circular
model enriches our understanding of this type of data and new tools are
introduced to make the interpretation of effects from a PN mixed-effects model
easier.
