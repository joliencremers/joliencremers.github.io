## Circular Data in the Social Sciences

During my masters and PhD I worked on developing Bayesian methods for the
analysis of circular (longitudinal) data in the social sciences, mostly using
the embedding approach to circular data, specifically on models employing the
projected normal (PN) distribution. A copy of the dissertation can be found [[here]]().

The embedding approach models the circular location and spread are modeled
simultaneously and is very flexible regarding the type of models that can be
fit. Interpretation of the parameter estimates from these models is however
challenging, so several subprojects focus on the development of interpretation
tools.


#### PN regression models

Performance of two MCMC algorithms for estimating PN regression models is
investigated. In this project, we have also analysed data from an interpersonal
circumplex using the PN regression model.

Several measures were developed that make the interpretation of regression
effects on the circle easier.

Several tools that can be used to distinguish between accuracy and location
effects in a PN regression model are introduced and compared.


#### PN mixed-effects models

Application of a Bayesian PN mixed-effects model to several repeated measures
datasets from an interpersonal circumplex. The focus lies on how a circular
model enriches our understanding of this type of data and new tools are
introduced to make the interpretation of effects from a PN mixed-effects model
easier.


#### Wrapped Normal and Cauchy regression

**Cremers, J.**, Jansen, I., &, Klugkist, I. (unpublished) Bayesian Analysis of Circular Data Using the Wrapping Approach. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/joliencremers/regression_wrapping)

A Bayesian circular regression model based on the wrapping approach is introduced. 


#### A tutorial on circular data in cognitive psychology

This tutorial introduces the R-package bpnreg for Bayesian PN regression and
mixed-effects models.


#### Cylindrical models for circumplex data.

- **Cremers, J.**, Pennings, H.J.M & Ley, C. (in press). Regression Models for Cylindrical Data in Psychology. *Multivariate Behavioral Analysis*. [[Full-text]](https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2019.1693332)

Four models for cylindrical data are extended and fit to circumplex data.
