## The Analysis of Circumplex Data Using Circular Statistics

One type of circular data in the social sciences is data from so-called
circumplex measurement instruments. In my research on circular data I have used
data from the interpersonal circumplex as illustrations and argued for the use
of circular (or more general, cylindrical) methods for the analysis of these
data.

#### Regression 
A Bayesian PN regression model is used for the analysis of teacher behavior data
from an interpersonal circumplex.

#### Mixed-effects (longitudinal data) 
In this project a Bayesian PN mixed-effects model is applied to several datasets
with repreated measures from an interpersonal circumplex. The focus lies on how
a circular model enriches our understanding of this type of data and new tools
are introduced to make the interpretation of effects from a PN mixed-effects
model easier.

In another project we've applied a PN mixed-effects model to teacher behavior
data measured on a circumplex and a linear measurement instrument.

#### Cylindrical models

Four models for cylindrical data are extended and fit to circumplex data.
