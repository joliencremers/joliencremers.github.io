## The Analysis of Circumplex Data Using Circular Statistics

One type of circular data in the social sciences is data from so-called
circumplex measurement instruments. In my research on circular data I have used
data from the interpersonal circumplex as illustrations and argued for the use
of circular (or more general, cylindrical) methods for the analysis of these
data.

A Bayesian PN regression model is used for the analysis of teacher behavior data
from an interpersonal circumplex.

#### Mixed-effects

Application of a Bayesian PN mixed-effects model to several repeated measures
datasets from an interpersonal circumplex. The focus lies on how a circular
model enriches our understanding of this type of data and new tools are
introduced to make the interpretation of effects from a PN mixed-effects model
easier.

Application of a PN mixed-effects model to investigate the association between
teacher-student interpersonal relations and instructional expertise.

#### Cylindrical models

Four models for cylindrical data are extended and fit to circumplex data.
