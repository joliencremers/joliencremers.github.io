## The Analysis of Circumplex Data Using Circular Statistics

One type of circular data in the social sciences is data from so-called circumplex measurement instruments. In my research on circular data I have used data from the interpersonal circumplex as illustrations and argued for the use of circular (or more general, cylindrical) methods for the analysis of these data.

#### Regression 
A Bayesian PN regression model is used for the analysis of teacher behavior data from an interpersonal circumplex. [[link]](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1614-2241/a000147)

#### Mixed-effects (longitudinal data) 
A Bayesian PN mixed-effects model is used for longitudinal teacher behavior data from an interpersonal 
circumplex. The focus lies on how a circular model enriches our understanding of this type of data and new tools are introduced to make 
the interpretation of effects from a PN mixed-effects model easier. 

#### Cylindrical models

Four models for cylindrical data are extended and fit to circumplex data. [[link]](https://github.com/joliencremers/CylindricalComparisonCircumplex)

#### Tutorial
A tutorial using the R-package `bpnreg' for Bayesian PN regression and mixed-effects models. [[link]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02040/abstract)
