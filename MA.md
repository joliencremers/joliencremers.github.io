Application of a Bayesian PN mixed-effects model to several repeated measures
datasets from an interpersonal circumplex. The focus lies on how a circular
model enriches our understanding of this type of data and new tools are
introduced to make the interpretation of effects from a PN mixed-effects model
easier.
