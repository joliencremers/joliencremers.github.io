## Modelling Life Trajectories from Registry Data

- **Cremers, J.**, Mortensen, L.H. & Ekstrøm, C.T. (submitted). A Joint Model for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data in Life Course Research: Employment Status and Time to Retirement.

In this paper we introduce a Bayesian joint model for longitudinal and
time-to-event data to analyse the dependence between employment status and time
to retirement in three Danish population cohorts that are differently affected
by a policy reform in early retirement age.
