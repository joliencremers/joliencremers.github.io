## About me

I'm a researcher at the University of Copenhagen and Danmarks Statistik who is interested in modeling life trajectories from registry data using both methods from event-history analysis and Bayesian networks.

Other research interests include: circular data analysis, multi-level/hierarchical modelling, Bayesian data analysis and modelling data from circumplex measurement instruments.
